# HelloðŸ‘‹, I'm Fazza
I am a **Fullstack-able Frontend developer**. An open source enthusiast. Currently exploring motion and web design. An avid the Primeagen watcher.

ðŸ˜Ž I review code from student submission (primarily frontend and react learning path) on [Dicoding Indonesia](https://www.dicoding.com/users/fazza_amiarso/academies).

âš¡  I strive to make high quality and accessible software that everyone can enjoy.

ðŸ“‘ I love to share my knowledge by sharing it on [my blog](https://dev.to/fazzaamiarso).

ðŸ¤— I help other developers on [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) when I have free time.
